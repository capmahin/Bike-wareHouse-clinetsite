        By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest manufacturer,[31] with their
        motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.[32][33] Amongst many
        British motorcycle manufacturers, Chater-Lea with its twin-cylinder
        models followed by its large singles in the 1920s stood out. Initially,
        using converted a Woodmann-designed ohv Blackburne engine it became the
        first 350 cc to exceed 100 mph (160 km/h), recording 100.81 mph (162.24
        km/h) over the flying kilometre during April 1924.[7] Later, Chater-Lea
        set a world record for the flying kilometre for 350 cc and 500 cc
        motorcycles at 102.9 mph (165.6 km/h) for the firm. Chater-Lea produced
        variants of these world-beating sports models and became popular among
        racers at the Isle of Man TT. Today, the firm is probably best
        remembered for its long-term contract to manufacture and supply AA
        Patrol motorcycles and sidecars.
