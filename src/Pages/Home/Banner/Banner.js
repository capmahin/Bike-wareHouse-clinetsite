          <p>
            The Ducati 998 is a sport bike made by Ducati from 2002 to 2004. It
            was the successor to the Ducati 996 and the final variation on the
            Ducati 916. The new Testastretta engine shared many similarities
            with the previous Desmoquattro engine in the 996, although it was
            completely new from the crankshaft up.
